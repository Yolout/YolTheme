# YolTheme

My two Aliucord themes I made for the sake of colors.


**ARTEMIS**

-Basically, 50 shads of blue.

-Colors taken from drawings of the VTuber Artemis of the Blue.


**MIYO**

-Mix of dark red, cyan and orange, very experimental.

-Like the other theme, colors taken from drawings of Shiki Miyoshino.



# Planned themes

-Dark theme: Colors based on the FlyByWire tablet UI in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

-Light theme: Colors based on the VTuber Amelia Watson.
